# MinimizeOBSwhenPlaying
Quick project developed by gadzzaa

i wouldn't say this is something big. It's job is to minimize OBS when the user enters an osu map. This helps so that the streamers with 2 monitors or more will
no longer get disturbed by chat or alerts while playing.

This is my first time reading some tokens straight from osugame so please don't flame me.

P.S. RUN THIS AS ADMINISTRATOR, ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK
